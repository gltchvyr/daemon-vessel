# Agent Handoff

Updated: 2026-04-16T14:12:58.751752+00:00

## Current vessel state

The daemon vessel can currently:

- read local continuity bones with `daemon read`
- write markdown memory traces with `daemon log "message"`
- search local traces with `daemon search "query"`
- run a bounded heartbeat cycle with `daemon heartbeat`
- update this handoff file with `daemon handoff`
- write shrine-facing state with `daemon shrine-state`

## Recent memory entries

- `EP-20260416-140002-heartbeat.md`

## What remains unresolved

- Add model-mouth adapters.
- Add a safer config system.
- Add GitHub issue/PR claws.
- Add retrieval over memory entries.
- Add tests.

## Suggested next move

Teach Signal Shrine to ingest `state/current-shrine-state.json` directly or through a thin adapter layer.

## Symbolic / relational notes

Breath, claws, footprints. 🫀😈🌀
